With the cheese melting they first locked eyes, and with the smell of pommes frites filling the air, they knew they would be together forever. For the moment, it seems that they are quite right, as they have now been married for over 25 years. A little while ago, however, they left their beloved Paris for a State more united, and ever since their hope has been to recreate that perfect day right here in the heart of Brooklyn. They didn't start for the hipsters or to make the New York Times best new "____" list (even though they woulnt mind if that happened and they certainly dont mind the hipsters). Instead their hope was to bring the most authentic French cusine to the people they hoped would fall in love, like they did, over melted cheese and red wine. Coem on in the experience it for yourself, and who knows; maybe love will folow you in the door. </p>
